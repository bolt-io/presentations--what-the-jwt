# What the JWT? - Securing your applicaiton with Microsoft Identity Web

The community presentation is available [here](./What%20the%20JWT%20-%20Securing%20your%20app%20with%20Microsft%20Identity%20Web.pdf).

Both implementations in this repository use [Azure AD B2C](https://aka.ms/aadb2c) and call a downstream API.

For the awkward, cumbersome, and complex way of implementing Authorization, you can find the project under [b2c-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet](./b2c-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet).

The simplified, robust, and more secure implementation using Microsoft Identity Web can be found under [b2c-webapp-miw-downstream](./b2c-webapp-miw-downstream).
